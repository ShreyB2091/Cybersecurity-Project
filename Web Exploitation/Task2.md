# **TASK 2**

## Page Source
The page source is the human-readable code returned to the client from the web server each time a request is made. The returned code consists of HTMLL, CSS and JavaScript.  
It instructs the browser how and what content to display.  
To view the page source of a webpage, you can right-click and select "view page source" option. Most of the browsers also support putting 'view-source:' before the URL to view the page source.  
Looking at the comments in the page source may provide insights to some private areas used to store company/customer information.

## Developer Tools - Inspector
Developer Tools is a tool kit used to assisst developers in debugging web applications. We can use these tools to get a better understanding of the web application.  
The page source doesn't represent what's shown on the webpage everytime, so we use element inspector to provide a live representation of what is visible on the website.  
We can edit and interact with the page elements using this developer tool.  
Any changes we make to the CSS or HTML content of the page will be reflected on the local browser. However, it is only edited on the browser window and changes back to normal on reloading the page.

## Developer Tools - Debugger
To dig deep into the JavaScript code of a webpage, a developer tool debugger is used.  
This feature is called Debugger in Firefox and Safari and in Google Chrome it is called Sources.  
Breakpoints can be set in the code which pause the program at that particular step until a continue command is recieved. This helps to view the state of the application after any step thereby helping to identify the flaw in the code.

## Developer Tools - Network
The network tab in developer tools is used to track all external requests made by a webpage.  
All the files requested by a page can be viewed on refreshing the page.  
AJAX method is a request method in which data is sent and received in a web application background without interfering.
