# Assignment2 -> Basic Shell Scripting

In this week, the mentees were introduced to bash scripting and how to use it to automate daily tasks. Bash is like a complete language in itself with for loops, if-else statement and even functions.

Some general guidelines:
1. Ask all general doubts in the general-doubts  channel.
2. If you have any doubts in which you need our help, tag us we will either join you on voice channel or clarify the doubt on text
3. You can use the voice channels too to communicate with your team members and with us.
Now, coming to the goals for the week.

## Bash Scripting
You can learn about bash in detail before proceeding to the task from here.

We expect you to be little familiar with python , so here are the assignments(it is not a compulsory assignment, those who don't know python or those who are eager to dive deeper into python can do this):

1. Assignment 1- Youâ€™re supposed to the HW1 from this link: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis192/tliu/ . Lecture slides are there to guide you.

2. Assignment 2- This will be the problem set 2 at this link: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/assignments/ . Again, lecture slides/videos are present. You can refer to them.
